Net-Nessus-FastAttack version 0.01
==================================

This module is designed to perform a quick nessus attack on a given host.
The target system for this is NetReg and self scan type CGI applications.

Nessus was chosen because (it is hoped) plugins can be chosen by our 
security group and implemented by us with no coding changes.

So far we've been testing this successfully for several weeks now.
It's been tested on Solaris running Apache/Apacah2 mod_perl with no problems.

Our topology consists of a single netreg system and 2 load balanced nessusd servers.
I'm running nessusd (Nessus) 2.0.9 for SunOS which talks NTP 1.2.

As many folks might know older protocol versions sent you all plugin and
preferences at login time.
This could take several minutes.
NTP 1.2 comes with (undocumented) <fast login>, this make cgi applications 
possible.


I'll attempt to address any problems or suggestions about this module.
You can contact me directly or via this list.

If I get enough feedback I'l post this to CPAN
